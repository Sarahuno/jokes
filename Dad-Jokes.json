But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost.\n\nThe people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.\n\nThe National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo."},
